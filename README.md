# Painting Variant Examples
A reference datapack and resource pack for Minecraft 1.21 and above that showcase the new data-driven Painting Variants. To learn how to create them, you can follow the tutorial I wrote for the [Minecraft Wiki](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Tutorials/Adding_custom_paintings), or edit the provided example datapack and resource pack provided [here]([url](https://github.com/cassiancc/painting-variant-example/releases/tag/1.0-1.21-pre4)).

- You'll need either `painting-example-datapack - 1.21.1` for 1.21.1 and 1.21 or `painting-example-datapack - 1.21.2+` for 1.21.2 and above.
- You'll need `painting-example-resource-pack` for 1.21 and above.

Please note that to apply changes to the datapack, you'll need to leave and rejoin the world , as `/reload` doesn't work in this case. Changes to the resource pack can be done via `F3-T` like normal. Using this datapack will also mark your world as using Experimental Settings.

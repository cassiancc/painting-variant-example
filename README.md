# Painting variant examples
A Datapack and Resource Packs for Minecraft 1.21 Pre-Release 4 that showcases how to add new Painting Variants.

Please note that to apply changes to the datapack, you'll need to leave and rejoin the world , as `/reload` doesn't work in this case. Changes to the resource pack can be done via `F3-T` like normal. Using this datapack will also mark your world as using Experimental Settings.

This datapack and resource pack supplements the tutorial I wrote for the [Minecraft Wiki](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Tutorials/Adding_custom_paintings).
